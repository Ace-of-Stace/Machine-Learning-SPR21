    "Solar physics heavily relies on analysis of solar image data. These images and the process of accessing them can be challenging, and getting them machine learning ready can be a huge barrier to using them in machine learning applications. If a pipeline from the solar databases to trainable data was created, it could be used with more agency in the solar physics space. For this project we will be standing up a solar data image pipeline, that will allow us to train a network on different wavelength data. We will accomplish this by breaking into two sub-teams, and tackling the pipeline and the network. Finally, when the pipeline is established, we will use a custom CNN to classify wavelengths and work to extend this result to composite images as well. _(As with the last project, we will also contribute to the other sub-team through discussion posts)_"
