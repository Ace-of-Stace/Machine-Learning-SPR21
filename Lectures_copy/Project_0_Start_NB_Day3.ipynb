There are examples included that help to showcase, plotting, DataFrames, json files, np.arrays as well as many other python tools. In addition to these python elements, we also have the integration and utilization of the a production version of the code from class. The result of the code allows us to compare KNN and Kmeans and reflect on the differences as we start to build foundational intuition around these two tools.   "
